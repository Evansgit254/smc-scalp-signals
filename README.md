## 📖 Overview

The **Pure Quant Research Terminal** is a deterministic trading-signal research system with paper-execution infrastructure and a MetaAPI execution bridge. Current database evidence supports research and paper validation; live broker performance is not yet proven by the active ledger.

The system is optimized for **H1/H4 Macro Trends** and **M5/M15 Institutional Execution Windows**, focusing on surgical entries within high-probability liquidity zones.

## 🚀 Active Alpha Modules

### 1. CRT (Candle Range Theory)
Authentic implementation of institutional range mechanics.
*   **Daily Bias**: D1 order flow synchronization.
*   **Killzone Logic**: Precise execution windows (London/NY).
*   **Range Forensics**: H1/H4 reference range tracking with M5 Market Structure Shifts (MSS).

### 2. Advanced Pattern
Maintained pattern-extension engine for strict price-action setups.
*   **Day-of-Week Context**: Pattern scoring respects recurring weekday behavior.
*   **Pin-Bar Stop Hunts**: Reversal detection around stop-run candle structures.
*   **Locked Scope**: CRT and Advanced Pattern are the only active signal engines.

### 3. Shared Structural Alpha Kernel
*   **Velocity Alpha**: Normalized momentum measurement for volatility-adjusted trend strength.
*   **Regime-Adaptive Filters**: Dynamic logic shifts between trending and mean-reverting states.
*   **Active Strategy Scope**: CRT and Advanced Pattern only.

## Performance Matrix (Database-Derived)

Latest audited benchmark: `database/backtest_results.db`, Run ID `58`, date range `2026-05-01` to `2026-05-29`.

| Metric | CRT Strategy (H1) | Advanced Patterns |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Closed Trades** | 2,720 | 10 |
| **Win Rate** | 71.1% | 50.0% |
| **Net Profit** | +1,034.1R | +2.3R |
| **Status** | Core baseline | Active research extension |

Run `63` is retained as historical evidence. Going forward, active signal generation is limited to CRT and Advanced Pattern.

## 🧪 Deployment & Auditing

### 1. Initialize Terminal
```bash
# Clone the institutional core
git clone https://github.com/Evansgit254/smc-scalp-signals.git
cd smc-scalp-signals

# Deploy Environment
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run Forensic Generator
Generate high-conviction signals with full reasoning forensics:
```bash
python app/generate_signals.py
```

### 3. Integrated Management (v5.1.1+)
Manage backups, updates, and rollbacks using the native maintenance script:
```bash
./manage.sh status     # Check versioning and DB health
./manage.sh backup     # Snapshot the signals database
./manage.sh update     # Pull code and run migrations
./manage.sh rollback   # Revert to previous stable release
```

### 4. Backtesting (Realistic Friction)
Run the backtest engine with spread and slippage modeling (1.0 pip handicap):
```bash
python run_backtest_cli.py --days 30
```

## ⚠️ Risk & Transparency

Trading financial markets involves significant risk. Current performance metrics are based on local backtest database records. The active execution ledger contains paper orders/fills only; it does not prove live broker fill quality or live profitability.

## 🔐 Operational Safety

- Stripe webhook processing requires `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` by default.
- Unsigned webhook payloads are only accepted when `ALLOW_UNSIGNED_STRIPE_WEBHOOK=true` is set for local development.
- Runtime configuration is centralized through `config/manager.py`, with `config/config.py` exposing compatibility snapshots for modules that still import constants.
- Admin config updates refresh the runtime config manager immediately, so service reads stay aligned with the database state within the same process.
- Live-trading toggles such as `mt5_auto_trade` and `mt5_paper_mode` require `risk_manager` access.
- Signal delivery reservation fails closed if the dedupe database is unavailable, so a storage fault will block delivery instead of duplicating it.
- Test markers now separate `integration`, `live`, and `authentic` coverage so local runs can skip external dependencies cleanly.
