# Pure Quant Institutional Terminal (v5.3.0) — Technical Implementation Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive technical overview of the **Pure Quant Institutional Terminal**, an institutional-grade algorithmic engine designed for structural liquidity tracking and deterministic execution. The V5.3.0 release is validated by deep structural evidence yielding strict >70% WR constraints.

---

## 1. Architectural Philosophy
The terminal is built on **Structural Alpha Factors**. It rejects "black-box" machine learning in favor of pure institutional price action mechanics (ICT/SMC) and statistical mean reversion.

### Core Principles:
- **Structural Integrity**: Signals are derived from market transitions, not lagging indicators.
- **Liquidity Awareness**: Logic accounts for high-impact liquidity pools and "trap" zones.
- **Friction-Aware**: V5.1.1 engine models real-world spread (0.8 pips) and slippage (0.2 pips) before certifying alpha.
- **Regime-Adaptive**: Logic utilizes a 4-cluster Gaussian Mixture Model (TRENDING_BULL, TRENDING_BEAR, VOLATILE_RANGE, LOW_VOL_RANGE).

## 2. Mathematical Kernels (Structural Alpha)

### A. Candle Range Theory (CRT) Modules
Authentic implementation of ICT Killzone mechanics.
- **Daily Bias Sync**: Dynamic D1 directional tracking.
- **Killzone Filtration**: Automated execution restriction to high-volatility sessions (London/NY).
- **MSS Logic**: Discovery of Market Structure Shifts on M5/M15 timeframes.

### B. Displacement Alpha (FVG)
- **Logic**: Algorithmic discovery of algorithmic price imbalances.
- **Feature**: Detects large-candle gaps that represent institutional "footprints."
- **Execution**: Optimizes entries at the 50% (Consequent Encroachment) or 0.25% levels of the displacement.

### C. Velocity Engine
- **Logic**: Normalized Linear Regression Slope.
- **Purpose**: Measures the unitless speed of price movement relative to its recent volatility to confirm trend validity.

## 3. Alpha Combiner & Decision Core

The `AlphaCombiner` aggregates structural factors into a final conviction score.

| Regime | Structural Weight | Momentum Weight | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TRENDING_BULL** | 0.40 | 0.70 | High momentum follow-through |
| **TRENDING_BEAR** | 0.40 | 0.70 | Rapid bearish structural collapse |
| **VOLATILE_RANGE** | 0.80 | 0.20 | Mean reversion / Liquidity hunts |
| **LOW_VOL_RANGE** | 0.90 | 0.10 | Compression / Accumulation |

## 4. Institutional Model Stack

### A. CRT Alpha (Candle Range Theory)
1.  **Reference Range**: Tracks the *previous* session/hour candle's extremes.
2.  **Sweep Forensic**: Detects "Liquidity Hunts" outside the range.
3.  **Displacement Entry**: Waits for MSS + FVG formation back inside the range.
4.  **Targeting**: Surgical TP hits at Equilibrium, Opposite Extreme, and Extended Deviation.

### B. Advanced Pattern Alpha
- **Day-of-Week Context**: Scores recurring weekday behavior without enabling retired engines.
- **Pin-Bar Stop Hunts**: Detects strict stop-run reversal structures.
- **Current Status**: Maintained as the only active extension beside CRT.

## 5. Advanced Risk Management

The `RiskManager` is the system's "Safety Brain."

### Key Features:
- **Asymmetric Sizing**: Dynamically adjusts lot size based on proximity to high-impact news.
- **SATP (Spread-Adjusted Terminal Profit)**: Blocks trades if friction consumes >35% of the expected R-Multiple.
- **Layered Execution**: Automated position scaling (Aggressive -> Optimal -> Safety).

---

## 6. Global Integrity Filters
- **Macro Matrix**: Correlation scoring with the USD Index (DXY) to prevent over-exposure.
- **News Wash Zone**: Automated 30-minute blackout window around Red-Folder events.
- **Execution Guard**: Ensures 100% alignment between Signal Engine and MT5 Bridge state.

### 6.1 Operational Governance
- Stripe webhooks require `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` by default. An unsigned development bypass is only available when `ALLOW_UNSIGNED_STRIPE_WEBHOOK=true` is set explicitly.
- Runtime config is owned by `config/manager.py`. `config/config.py` remains as a compatibility snapshot for modules that still import constants, while live reads use the manager directly.
- Admin updates call `config_manager.refresh()` so config changes are visible immediately inside the running process.
- Live execution toggles such as `mt5_auto_trade` and `mt5_paper_mode` require `risk_manager` access through the admin API.
- Signal delivery reservation fails closed if the dedupe database cannot be written, which prevents duplicate broadcast or execution on storage faults.
- Test coverage is organized with `authentic`, `integration`, and `live` markers so local runs can exclude external dependencies cleanly.
- Test startup disables the background reconciliation loop when requested, preventing TestClient runs from starting broker-facing tasks.

## 7. Backtesting & Verification
The system uses a **Forensic Backtest Suite** that:
1.  Simulates M5 tick-level price action for H1 models.
2.  Models realistic institutional friction (Institutional Raw Spreads).
3.  Calculates Profit Factor, expectancy, and drawdown diagnostics.

Latest database baseline: `database/backtest_results.db`, Run ID `63`, date range `2026-04-07` to `2026-05-29`.

| Model | Closed Trades | Win Rate | Net R | Status |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | :--- |
| CRT (H1) | 2,720 | 71.1% | +1,034.1R | Core baseline |
| Advanced Patterns | 10 | 50.0% | +2.3R | Active research extension |

Run `63` total remains historical evidence. Active signal generation is now intentionally limited to CRT and Advanced Patterns.

## 8. Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.12 (High-performance NumPy/Pandas integration).
- **Execution**: Async Signal Service + Institutional Dashboard.
- **Broker Bridge**: Python MetaTrader 5 API Gateway.
- **Interface**: High-Density Institutional Dashboard (Tailwind/JS).

| **CRT (H1)** | 71.1% | +1,034.1R |
| **Advanced Patterns** | 50.0% | +2.3R |

## 10. Optimization Vectors
*When utilizing the AI Optimization Layer:*
1.  **Liquidity Map Decay**: Are Asian session traps losing edge in the current regime?
2.  **FVG Sensitivity**: Fine-tuning displacement thresholds for low-volatility periods.
3.  **Macro Weighting**: Improving the DXY correlation filter for multi-pair baskets.
