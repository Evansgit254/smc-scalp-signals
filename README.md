## 📖 Overview

The **Pure Quant Institutional Terminal** is a high-fidelity algorithmic trading system designed for professional-grade execution. Rejecting the standard retail approach of subjective pattern recognition, this terminal utilizes **Institutional Liquidity Models** and **Deterministic Alpha Kernels** to identify structural market inefficiencies.

The system is optimized for **H1/H4 Macro Trends** and **M5/M15 Institutional Execution Windows**, focusing on surgical entries within high-probability liquidity zones.

## 🚀 Key Alpha Modules

### 1. CRT (Candle Range Theory)
Authentic implementation of institutional range mechanics.
*   **Daily Bias**: D1 order flow synchronization.
*   **Killzone Logic**: Precise execution windows (London/NY).
*   **Range Forensics**: H1/H4 reference range tracking with M5 Market Structure Shifts (MSS).

### 2. SMC Liquidity Models
*   **Asian Range Traps**: Identification of liquidity pools above/below the consolidation.
*   **Displacement Detection**: Algorithmic discovery of institutional "fingerprints" (FVGs/OBs).
*   **Sweep + Reversal**: Statistical modeling of liquidity hunts followed by trend resumption.

### 3. Structural Alpha Kernel
*   **Velocity Alpha**: Normalized momentum measurement for volatility-adjusted trend strength.
*   **POC Edge**: Volume-weighted mean reversion relative to the Point of Control.
*   **Regime-Adaptive Filters**: Dynamic logic shifts between trending and mean-reverting states.

## 🧪 Deployment & Auditing

### 1. Initialize Terminal
```bash
# Clone the institutional core
git clone https://github.com/Evansgit254/smc-scalp-signals.git
cd smc-scalp-signals

# Deploy Environment
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run Forensic Generator
Generate high-conviction signals with full reasoning forensics:
```bash
python app/generate_signals.py
```

### 3. Integrated Management (v5.1.1+)
Manage backups, updates, and rollbacks using the native maintenance script:
```bash
./manage.sh status     # Check versioning and DB health
./manage.sh backup     # Snapshot the signals database
./manage.sh update     # Pull code and run migrations
./manage.sh rollback   # Revert to previous stable release
```

### 4. Backtesting (Realistic Friction)
Run the backtest engine with spread and slippage modeling (1.0 pip handicap):
```bash
python run_backtest_cli.py --days 30
```

## ⚠️ Risk & Transparency

*Trading financial markets involves significant risk. This system uses deterministic models which, while statistically robust, do not eliminate the risk of capital loss. All performance metrics are based on forensic backtesting and real-world execution logs.*
